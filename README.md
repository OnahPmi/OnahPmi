- 👋 Hi, I’m @OnahPmi
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Machine Learning and Bioinformatics
- ☺️ I have keen interest in Data analytics and Machine Learning (ML), focused  particularly on Cheminformatics for the development of predictive models and algorithms, understanding of Ligand-protein interactions, and for the intended purpose of making better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization. I am particularly interested in developing models through well-trained algorithms that can make predictions on the the interactions of small and large molecules with target proteins and DNA.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on teams to build innovative programs that can reshape and better how certain things are done, especially a Bioinformatics project
