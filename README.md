# Biography
Hello, my name is Emmanuel Onah, a passionate individual with a deep interest in Python, Machine Learning, and Bioinformatics. My enthusiasm lies in the realm of data analytics and machine learning, specifically focusing on Cheminformatics. I am dedicated to developing predictive models and algorithms that can revolutionize the understanding of Ligand-protein interactions. By leveraging these tools, I aim to accelerate the process of drug lead identification and optimization, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.
I am eagerly seeking collaboration opportunities with like-minded professionals to create innovative programs that have the power to reshape and elevate existing methodologies. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the field of Bioinformatics, where I believe technology can play a vital role in transforming the way we approach complex biological problems.
